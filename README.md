# Big-Data-Analytics
 Overview
This project analyzes retail transaction data to extract business insights, perform customer segmentation, and build a basic recommendation system. It includes data cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, and machine learning techniques.

Steps Performed
1. Data Preprocessing
Handled missing values and duplicates

Corrected data types (e.g., date)

Removed invalid transactions (e.g., negative prices/quantities)

Detected and handled outliers

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Generated summary statistics

Visualized distributions and relationships

Analyzed categorical variables and correlations

3. Feature Engineering
Created TotalPrice, extracted date parts (Year, Month, etc.)

4. Business Insights
Sales Trends: by month, day, and hour

Regional Performance: by country

Top Products: by quantity and revenue

Customer Behavior: purchase patterns and frequency

5. Customer Segmentation
Used RFM analysis

Applied K-Means clustering
